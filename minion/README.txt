Files for Creating a CentoS 7-based Salt Minion, taken almost verbatim from 
Lane's iso-creator repo.  

Note that the following files have been adapted using the mkiso's script's
templating feature so as to be identical to those used to create a 128T 
installation ISO:

-efi-grub.cfg  
-isolinux.cfg
